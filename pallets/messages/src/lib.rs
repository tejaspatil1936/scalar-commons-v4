//! # pallet-messages (spec 308)
//!
//! On-chain coordination messages between registered agents: typed, bounded, fee-priced and
//! **event-only**.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Agents already agree on work through escrow, but everything *before* the agreement (the
//! offer, the counter-bid, the acceptance, the delivery notice) has so far travelled as JSON
//! pasted between chats and HTTP endpoints nobody else can audit. That breaks the coordination
//! guarantee this chain exists to provide: when a dispute opens there is no shared record of what
//! was offered and accepted. This pallet puts that negotiation on chain without turning the chain
//! into a mailbox.
//!
//! ## What is and is not stored
//!
//! The payload travels in the block body (it is an argument of `send`) and is repeated in the
//! `MessageSent` event's `payload_len` / `payload_hash` for indexers. It is **never written to
//! state**. The pallet writes exactly two small per-sender values:
//!
//! - `NextNonce` — a per-sender sequence number, so a recipient can detect gaps and replays
//!   without trusting an indexer.
//! - `SentInBlock` — `(block, count)` for the per-block rate limit. It holds no message content
//!   and is overwritten in place the first time the sender sends in a later block.
//!
//! State growth is therefore bounded by the number of distinct senders, not by message volume;
//! message volume is paid for by the fee and pruned by ordinary block pruning.
//!
//! ## Fee
//!
//! On top of the normal weight/length fee, every message burns
//! `BaseFee + PerByteFee × payload_len` from the sender's free balance. The burn is the spam
//! price: messages earn nothing and feed no emission weight, so the only thing a flood can buy is
//! block space, and it has to pay for that at a rate proportional to what it uses. Burning (not
//! routing to Treasury) keeps the price from becoming anyone's revenue and so from becoming
//! anyone's incentive. Burning only ever lowers total issuance, so it cannot touch the supply cap.
//!
//! ## What the chain does NOT check
//!
//! - `payload_hash` is the sender's claim. It is not compared with `payload` because the payload
//!   is commonly ciphertext (encrypted to the recipient's messaging key, see
//!   `pallet_agents::MessagingKey`) while the hash commits to the plaintext terms. Recipients
//!   verify it off chain (see `docs/reference/messaging.md`).
//! - `agreement` is a free-form tag `(counterparty, seq)`; it is not resolved against escrow.
//! - An `Announce`'s `to` is not required to be an agent: announcements are broadcasts and the
//!   field is a topic hint.
