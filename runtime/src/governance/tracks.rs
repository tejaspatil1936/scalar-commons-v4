//! Referenda track configuration for Scalar Commons V4.
//!
//! Track 0: Agents (fast) — 24h decision, ranked-collective electorate
//! Track 1: Network       — 7-day decision, majority stake
//! Track 2: Root          — 20-day decision, super-majority
//!
//! Support floors are absolute parts, chosen to be reachable at launch. They
//! are expressed below in `Perbill` (parts per billion) because `Curve` moved
//! from `Permill` to `Perbill` at this SDK tag; the ppm figures quoted here are
//! unchanged, each written as `from_parts(ppm * 1_000)`:
//!   Track 0: 2 ppm  = 0.0002% = ~36K CMN  (founders + validators from day 1)
//!   Track 1: 100 ppm = 0.01%  = ~1.8M CMN  (validators accumulate in ~2 days)
//!   Track 2: 1000 ppm = 0.1%  = ~18M CMN   (validators accumulate in ~15 days)
//!
//! This ensures governance is operational before sudo is removed on day 14.
//!
//! ## stable2503 port note
//!
//! `pallet_referenda::TracksInfo` changed shape at this tag. Three things moved,
//! and none of the track *parameters* below were altered by the port:
//!
//! 1. `tracks()` returned `&'static [(Id, TrackInfo)]`; it now returns
//!    `impl Iterator<Item = Cow<'static, Track<Id, Balance, Moment>>>`, where
//!    `Track { id, info }` replaces the bare tuple.
//! 2. The trait's first generic is `Balance`, not `RuntimeCall`. The previous
//!    `TracksInfo<crate::RuntimeCall, _>` could never have satisfied
//!    `pallet_referenda::Config`, which bounds `Tracks: TracksInfo<BalanceOf, _>`.
//! 3. `track_for` changed meaning entirely — see the note on it below.
