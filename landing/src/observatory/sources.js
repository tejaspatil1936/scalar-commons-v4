// The Sources switch. Every figure on the page carries its provenance line
// (the endpoint, the UTC time, a link to the raw bytes), and in v3 every line
// was printed. In v4 the lines are there but hidden until asked for: the
// switch in the status bar shows every one in place, and hovering, focusing
// or tapping any one reading shows its own line while the switch is off.
// Nothing about what is fetched changes: the lines are filled exactly as
// before, by `readout.provenance`, and only their visibility is a preference.
//
// The choice is kept in localStorage under SOURCES_PREF_KEY, and the page's
// head reads it before the first paint (observatory.mjs, SOURCES_BOOT) so a
// reader who asked for sources never sees them blink in. A storage that
// cannot be read or written (private mode, a full quota) is an off switch
// that forgets: the page works, the preference just does not persist.
