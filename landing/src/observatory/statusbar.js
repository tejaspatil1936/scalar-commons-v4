// The status bar: one slim line at the very top of the page with a live dot,
// a word for the network's state, how many of the validators have been seen
// sealing, the finality lag and the block height counting up. It draws
// nothing of its own: every figure here is the hero's, carried on the page
// bus with the record it came from, and the validator count is the same
// `Session.Validators` read the ring makes (the scheduler fetches it once).
// The line under the figures is the record's endpoint and time, as under
// every other reading. A live header arrives as `head`; a height from the
// polling fallback or the first indexed position arrives as `poll`, with no
// header and no author, and is folded in the same way.
//
// The state word is derived, and the rules are stated here so they can be
// checked: "Connecting" until a block has arrived; "Not updating" when the
// last read failed; "Polling" when the live stream could not be opened and
// the index is polled instead; "Paused" while the tab is hidden; "Finality
// lagging" when more than FINALITY_LAG_ALERT blocks wait for finality;
// "Blocks late" when the last block came more than LATE_MS after the one
// before; otherwise "Network normal". The validators phrase states the size
// of the active set from the chain read ("5 validators in the active set"),
// and only once the page has been open for SEALING_GRACE_MS adds how many
// distinct validators have been seen sealing since it opened. On load it
// says nothing about who has sealed: "2 of 5 seen so far" read as three
// validators down, when it only meant the page had seen two blocks.
