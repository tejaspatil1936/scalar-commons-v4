//   blockTime             /v1/blocks?limit=200 — the seconds between consecutive
//                         blocks, oldest to newest, drawn inside the 5.5–6.5 s
//                         target band. A pair with no timestamp is a break in
//                         the line, not a segment.
//   agreementsCumulative  /v1/eras?limit=14 for the era boundaries, and the
//                         escrow.AgreementCreated events read back to the start
//                         of the oldest era drawn (agreementsReadFrom), counted
//                         into the twelve most recent whole settled eras plus
//                         the era still open; the running total over those eras
//                         (derived) is the line, the counts are the bars behind
//                         it. Eras whose span the fetched events do not reach
//                         are dropped, never shown short.
//   emissionCumulative    every settled era the index holds (/v1/eras, read
//                         whole) — the CMN each settlement paid out, as the
//                         pallet reported it, summed into a running total
//                         (derived); the per-era figure is the thin line. Total

//                         is given beneath as context: it counts the genesis
//                         endowment and validator rewards too, so it is never
//                         shown as what agents were paid.
//   agentsOverTime        every agents.AgentRegistered and UnstakeCompleted
//                         event the index holds, walked forward from the agents
//                         that /v1/agents says were registered before the index
//                         began. The two must reconcile with today's total, or

// dim ink so the four read as small multiples on one axis style;
// with d3-scale for the axes and d3-shape for the paths. Colours come from
// the design system's classes, so light and dark are the stylesheet's. None
// of it is live data — every figure here is history — so nothing in these
// strips uses the live accent.

// Motion: a strip is revealed left to right over 350 ms the first time it has
// data to show, once; later polls and resizes redraw without motion.
