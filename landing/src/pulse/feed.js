// The live feed behind /pulse: the one place the page learns that something
// happened on the chain, and the reason nothing on it moves without a real
// event behind it.
//
// The constellation animates runtime events, and the honest source of those
// is the finalized-block event index: `/v1/blocks/<n>/events` holds every
// event one finalized block emitted, in emission order, with the event's own
// id. So the feed follows finalized heads over the page's WebSocket and reads
// each new block exactly once — one request per block, never a poll of the
// event lists — and hands the page each matching event once, in block order,
// deduplicated by id. A poll of `/v1/events` would show the same event on
// every refresh and could never say "this just happened"; a per-block read
// can, and it is the only way the ticker's "4 s ago" is a claim about the
// chain rather than about the page's timer.
//
// What is live. An event is handed on only while it sits within the live
// window of the head (LIVE_WINDOW_BLOCKS, three minutes at six seconds a
// block). When the index falls further behind the chain than that, the feed
// reports `stale` and animates nothing until the index catches up: an old
// event drawn as new would be a lie about the present. When heads cannot be
// had at all — the socket is down and the status poll fails too — or a block
// read fails, the feed reports `unavailable` with the reason, and the page
// says so in a banner instead of drifting on what it last saw.
//
// Catching up. A block the index has not reached yet answers 404; the feed
// stops there and retries from that block on the next head. When the page
// falls behind the chain (a slow socket, a long read) the backlog is capped
// at BACKLOG_BLOCKS: older blocks are skipped and the gap is reported in the
// status reason, so the page stays near the present rather than replaying
// minutes of history as if it were happening now. After a hidden spell the
// backlog is dropped outright, for the same reason.
//
// The rest of the page's data rides the shared schedulers: the agents (every
// page of /v1/agents, 2,000 agents in ten pages), the open agreements
// (/v1/escrows, the threads), and the last hour's events from the six event
// lists, read back to the block of one hour ago exactly as the observatory's
// hour row reads them, and watched only once that block is known. The hour
// seeds the counters at load with index reads that carry provenance; it is
// never animated. Its watches use HOUR_PAGES = 5,
// a different page cap from the observatory's hour row (HOUR_PAGES = 10 in
// instruments/last-hour.js): the scheduler keys a bounded watch by
// `name:since:maxPages` and the first registrant's bound wins, so a shared
// key would silently hand this page another instrument's bound.
//
// Fallback. If the socket fails or closes, heads come from /v1/status every
// six seconds, with the index's `syncedHeight` as the block to read up to and
// the chain's `finalizedBlock` as the head the live window is measured from;
// the socket's reopening ends the poll.
