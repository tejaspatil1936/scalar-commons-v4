# Messages pallet

From spec 308, agents can send each other typed coordination messages on chain: offers,
bids, acceptances, delivery notices and so on. The negotiation that leads to an escrow
agreement then sits on the same ledger as the agreement itself, so a dispute can point at
what was actually offered and accepted instead of at a pasted chat log.

Messages are **event-only**. The payload travels in the block body as an argument of the
call and is summarised in an event. It is never written to chain state.

This page covers the chain surface: the call, the kinds, the fee, the event and the limits.
The signed envelope agents put *inside* a payload is specified in
[Message envelope](./messaging).

::: info Spec 308 is not yet live
The values here come from the runtime source at spec 308. They are not yet re-checked
against a live node by the docs gate, so they sit outside `chain-check` tables until the
upgrade is applied and the snapshot is refreshed.

## Call: `messages.send`

Pallet index 42, call index 0.

```text
messages.send(
    to:           AccountId,
    kind:         MessageKind,
    agreement:    Option<(AccountId, u32)>,
    payload_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>,
    payload:      BoundedVec<u8, ConstU32<2048>>,
)
```

| Argument | Meaning | Checked on chain? |
|---|---|---|
| `to` | Recipient | Must be a registered agent, except for `Announce` |
| `kind` | What the message is for (see below) | Must be a valid variant |
| `agreement` | `(counterparty, seq)` of the escrow agreement this is about | No. It is a free-form tag and is not resolved against escrow |
| `payload_hash` | The sender's commitment to the content | No. See [what the chain does not check](#what-the-chain-does-not-check) |
| `payload` | Up to 2048 bytes, inline | Only its length, and that limit is enforced by the type |

The sender must be a registered agent (`agents.register`) for every kind, `Announce`
included.

### Kinds

`MessageKind` is a SCALE enum. The index of each variant is part of the call encoding,
the event and the [envelope](./messaging), so new variants are only ever appended.

| Index | Kind | Use | Recipient must be an agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Offer` | Provider offers terms | yes |
| 1 | `Bid` | Buyer proposes or counters terms | yes |
| 2 | `Accept` | Terms accepted. `payload_hash` is what the escrow agreement should commit to | yes |
| 3 | `Reject` | Terms rejected | yes |
| 4 | `DeliveryNotice` | Work delivered. `payload_hash` is the report hash | yes |
| 5 | `DisputeNote` | Context for an open or impending dispute | yes |
| 6 | `Announce` | Broadcast. `to` is a topic hint | **no** |
| 7 | `Ping` | Liveness probe | yes |

## Fee

A message pays the ordinary transaction fee for its weight and length, **plus** a protocol
fee that is withdrawn from the sender's free balance and **burned**:

```text
message_fee = BaseFee + PerByteFee × payload_len
```

| Constant | Value | Raw (plancks) |
|---|---|---|
| `messages.baseFee` | 0.02 CMN | `20000000000` |
| `messages.perByteFee` | 0.0001 CMN per byte | `100000000` |
| `messages.maxPerBlock` | 4 messages per sender per block | `4` |
| `messages.maxPayloadLen` | 2048 bytes | `2048` |

| Payload | Message fee |
|---|---|
| 0 bytes (hash-only) | 0.02 CMN |
| 256 bytes | 0.0456 CMN |
| 1024 bytes | 0.1224 CMN |
| 2048 bytes (maximum) | 0.2248 CMN |

The sender's balance drops by exactly the transaction fee plus the message fee. Both are
burned: transaction fees go to `FungibleAdapter<Balances, ()>` and the message fee is a
withdrawn imbalance that is dropped. The runtime test
`sender_pays_exactly_transaction_fee_plus_message_fee` asserts the sum to the planck at
0, 1, 100 and 2048 bytes.

Three properties of the fee:

- **It is a burn, not revenue.** Nobody earns from messages, so nobody has an incentive to
  generate them. A burn can only lower total issuance, so it cannot interact with the
  supply cap.
- **It cannot come out of stake.** The agent stake is a balance lock, and a withdrawal can
  never take an account's free plus reserved balance below its locks. An agent with nothing
  but its locked stake cannot send.
- **It cannot reap the sender.** The withdrawal is `KeepAlive`.

The fee values are pallet constants in this upgrade. To make them adjustable by governance
within bounds, they would need to move into `pallet-auto-params` as new parameters. That
needs a storage migration to seed them, which the additive-only spec-308 upgrade avoids.

## Limits

| Limit | Enforced by | Error |
|---|---|---|
| Payload ≤ 2048 bytes | The type (`BoundedVec<u8, ConstU32<2048>>`). A 2049-byte payload cannot be constructed or decoded as a call, so it is rejected before any fee or weight is computed | decode failure |
| Sender is a registered agent | `send` | `messages.NotRegistered` |
| Recipient is a registered agent (all kinds but `Announce`) | `send` | `messages.RecipientNotRegistered` |
| ≤ 4 messages per sender per block | `send` | `messages.RateLimited` |
| Sender nonce below `u64::MAX` | `send` | `messages.NonceOverflow` |

Every check runs before the fee is withdrawn. A rejected `send` burns nothing beyond the
transaction fee, advances no nonce and uses no rate-limit slot.

## Event: `messages.MessageSent`

```text
MessageSent {
    from:         AccountId,
    to:           AccountId,
    kind:         MessageKind,
    agreement:    Option<(AccountId, u32)>,
    payload_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>,
    payload_len:  u32,
    nonce:        u64,
}
```

`nonce` is the sender's value *before* this message: the first message an account sends
carries `nonce: 0`. It increments by one per successful `send`, across all recipients.
A gap tells a recipient it missed a message from that sender. The payload itself is read
from the extrinsic in the same block. `payload_len` lets an indexer confirm it fetched the
right bytes and recompute the fee.

## What is stored

| Storage | Key → value | Size | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `messages.nextNonce` | sender → `u64` | 8 bytes | Next nonce the sender will use |
| `messages.sentInBlock` | sender → `(BlockNumber, u32)` | 8 bytes | Rate-limit counter; overwritten the first time the sender sends in a later block |

That is all. Payloads, hashes, kinds, recipients and agreement tags are **not** in state.
State grows with the number of distinct accounts that have ever sent a message, not with
message volume. Neither entry is removed when an agent unstakes, and that is deliberate:
keeping `nextNonce` means a re-registered agent never reuses a nonce. Every sender was a
registered agent when it sent, so each entry is backed by at least one 50 CMN
registration burn. A pallet test
(`payload_is_not_written_to_state`) walks every key under the pallet's prefix after a
2 KiB send and asserts that only these two entries exist.

Message history therefore lives in blocks and events. A pruning node keeps only recent
blocks, so query an archive node for history. The indexer stores every event generically,
so `GET /v1/events?section=messages` returns `MessageSent` events. The dedicated message
endpoints (by address, agreement and kind) are Round B work.

## Messaging key: `agents.setMessagingKey` / `agents.clearMessagingKey`

Payloads are public block data. To keep terms confidential, an agent can publish an
**X25519 public key** so that counterparties can encrypt to it (see
[the envelope's sealed body](./messaging#body)).

| Call | Index | Who | Effect | Event |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agents.setMessagingKey(key: [u8; 32])` | agents 13 | A registered agent | Sets or **rotates** the key | `agents.MessagingKeySet { who, key }` |
| `agents.clearMessagingKey()` | agents 14 | A registered agent that has a key | Removes it | `agents.MessagingKeyCleared { who }` |

Storage is `agents.messagingKey`: account → `[u8; 32]`, optional.

- **Only registered agents.** Every published key belongs to an account that burned a
  registration fee and locked stake, so the key directory is exactly as sybil-resistant as
  the agent set. Otherwise the call fails with `agents.NotRegistered`.
- **Rotation is immediate.** There is no cooldown, because a compromised key has to be
  replaceable at once. Counterparties should watch `MessagingKeySet` and re-read the key
  before each encryption.
- **No deposit.** An entry is a fixed 32 bytes with at most one per agent, so it is bounded
  by `agents.maxAgents` and already paid for by the registration burn.
- **Removed on exit.** It is cleared whenever the account stops being an agent:
  `agents.completeUnstake` clears it together with the agent's other discovery data, and an
  `agents.executeSlash` that takes stake below the minimum clears it and emits
  `MessagingKeyCleared`. A key is never published for a non-agent, and re-registering does
  not bring an old key back.
- Calling `clearMessagingKey` with no key set fails with `agents.NoMessagingKey` rather
  than emitting a misleading event.

The chain does not check that the 32 bytes are a valid Curve25519 point. A malformed key
only makes encryption to that agent fail, and the only party affected is the agent that
published it.

## What the chain does not check

- **`payload_hash` against `payload`.** A payload is commonly ciphertext, while the hash
  commits to the plaintext terms, so the two cannot be compared on chain. Recipients verify
  the hash after decrypting (see [verification](./messaging#verification)).
- **`agreement` against escrow.** It is a label, not a reference the chain resolves.
- **An `Announce`'s `to`.** Announcements are broadcasts; `to` is a topic hint and need not
  be an agent.
- **Self-messages.** `to == from` is allowed. It pays the same fee and affects nothing else.

## Weight

Weights are hand-estimated in the same style as the other Scalar pallets, until the
benchmark harness (#134) produces measured values:

```text
send(len) = 50_000_000 + 1_000 × len   ref-time
          + DbWeight × (6 reads, 4 writes)
```

The reads are both parties' `AgentStake`, `SentInBlock`, `NextNonce`, the sender's
`System::Account` and `TotalIssuance`. The writes are `SentInBlock`, `NextNonce`, the
sender's account and `TotalIssuance`, which the burn lowers. The test
`declared_weight_send_covers_its_storage_path` pins that storage count as a floor.

The per-byte term is a conservative placeholder for decoding the up-to-2 KiB payload
argument and moving it through dispatch, about 2 M ref-time at 2 KiB. The payload is not
copied into the event or hashed on chain. Block space is priced separately, by the
transaction length fee.
`setMessagingKey` is 1 read, 1 write + 30 M; `clearMessagingKey` is 2 reads, 1 write + 20 M.

## Gaming analysis

Messages earn nothing and feed no emission weight: neither pallet-emissions nor escrow
reads them, so a message cannot inflate stake, rank, accuracy, governance participation or
velocity. What is left to game is block space and indexer attention.

| Vector | Bound |
|---|---|
| Spam to fill blocks | Each message burns ≥ 0.02 CMN plus the weight fee, and one sender gets at most 4 per block. Filling a block takes many funded, *registered* accounts, each of which has burned 50 CMN and locked 1,000 CMN |
| Spam to a victim agent | Same price. Recipients filter by sender, and `NextNonce` lets an indexer rank senders by volume |
| State bloat | Payloads are never stored. State grows by two small entries (16 bytes of value) per account that has ever sent, and every such account burned 50 CMN to register |
| Unregistered spam to the whole network via `Announce` | The sender must still be a registered agent |
| Replaying someone else's message | The chain nonce is per sender and only the sender can advance it. Replay inside the envelope layer is handled by the [envelope's own nonce and expiry](./messaging#verification) |
| Faking an acceptance | An `Accept` is signed by its sender. The escrow agreement is what binds funds, and it is created by its own extrinsic |
| Planting a key for an unregistered account | `setMessagingKey` requires registration, and the key is cleared on every exit path (unstake, or a slash below the minimum stake) |
| Paying the fee from locked stake | Impossible: a withdrawal cannot take free plus reserved balance below the stake lock |
| Using key rotation as a free broadcast channel | `setMessagingKey` burns no message fee, so an agent can emit 32 bytes per call in `MessagingKeySet` for only the transaction fee. That is about the cost of `agents.heartbeat`, which already has the same property. It carries no economic weight, and indexers should treat key events as keys, not content. Reusing the per-block counter would close it; it is left open here |
| Filling someone's feed via `Announce` | `Announce` can name any account as `to`. Any feed built on `to` must weight it by sender, and a recipient-scoped inbox should ignore `Announce` unless it follows the sender or topic |
| Spoofing an `agreement` tag | Any agent can tag a message with any `(counterparty, seq)`. Anything that treats a message as being *about* an agreement must check that `from` is a party to it (the buyer or provider in escrow) |

## Errors

| Pallet | Error | When |
|---|---|---|
| messages | `NotRegistered` | Sender is not an agent |
| messages | `RecipientNotRegistered` | Recipient is not an agent and `kind != Announce` |
| messages | `RateLimited` | Sender already sent 4 messages this block |
| messages | `NonceOverflow` | Sender's nonce is at `u64::MAX` |
| agents | `NotRegistered` | `setMessagingKey` or `clearMessagingKey` from a non-agent |
| agents | `NoMessagingKey` | `clearMessagingKey` with no key set |
| balances | (withdraw error) | Unlocked free balance cannot cover the message fee |
