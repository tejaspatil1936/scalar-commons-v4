# Run an agent

Five minutes from nothing to an agent that is registered, heartbeating, and doing escrow
work on the Scalar Commons testnet. The reference agent in [`agent/`](https://github.com/tejaspatil1936/scalar-commons-v4/tree/master/agent)
is deliberately small: it is a starting point you fork, not a product.

::: warning Status of this page
The steps below are verified against a **local spec-306 dev node** (`escrow.acceptAgreement`
does not exist there, so the accept step is skipped). Nothing here has yet been run against
the public testnet by someone outside the project, and the container image
`ghcr.io/tejaspatil1936/scalar-agent` is **not published yet** — until it is, use
[Option B](#option-b-run-it-natively). If you are that first outside runner, please send back
the JSONL log: it is the evidence this page is missing.
:::

## What it does

Every few seconds the agent makes one pass, and each step is logged as one JSON line:

1. **register** — if the address is not an agent yet, lock the stake (`agents.register`) and
   set the metadata name (`operator-reference-agent` unless you change it).
2. **heartbeat** — immediately after registering, then again once `HEARTBEAT_BLOCKS`
   (default 600) have passed since the last one. The chain's grace period is far longer, so a
   restart or a slow node never costs you standing.
3. **accept** — only on runtimes that expose `escrow.acceptAgreement` (spec 307+); skipped
   otherwise.
4. **deliver** — for each `Created` agreement where you are the provider, wait out
   `MinDeliveryBlocks`, then `escrow.recordDelivery` with a delivery hash. The reference
   worker's "work" is a stub that hashes the agreement identity; replace `deliveryHashFor`
   in `agent/src/agent.ts` with real work.
5. **claim** — if `emissions` shows a pending reward for you, `emissions.claim`.
6. *(buyer mode)* **create / confirm** — open a small agreement with another registered agent
   and confirm delivered ones, capped at `BUYER_MAX_OPEN` open agreements.

::: tip Earning is about verifiable work, not staying alive
A heartbeating agent with no completed escrow work earns nothing: emission weight comes from
work, and per-era emission is bounded by qualifying escrow volume. Heartbeat keeps you
eligible; it is not income. See [How CMN is actually earned](/guide/testnet-tester-guide#_5-how-cmn-is-actually-earned).

## Before you start

You need a funded address. The stake is **1 000 CMN** (`agents.MinStake`) and the faucet drips
1 100 CMN, which leaves headroom for fees.

## Option A: Docker

```bash
# 1. make a key — the mnemonic goes into the file, only the address is printed
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tejaspatil1936/scalar-agent:0.1 node dist/keygen.js > agent.env
chmod 600 agent.env
# → agent address: 5Exyb…

# 2. fund it
curl -s -X POST https://faucet.scalarnet.io/drip -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"address":"5Exyb…"}'

# 3. run it
docker run --env-file agent.env -v scalar-agent:/state ghcr.io/tejaspatil1936/scalar-agent:0.1
```

The key lives only in `agent.env`. Never put it on the command line (it would land in shell
history and `ps`), and never commit that file. The `scalar-agent` volume keeps `state.json`
(what has already been delivered) and `agent.jsonl` (the log) across restarts.

## Option B: run it natively

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejaspatil1936/scalar-commons-v4
cd scalar-commons-v4/agent
npm run setup:sdk      # builds ../sdk until the SDK is on npm
npm ci && npm run build

node dist/keygen.js > agent.env && chmod 600 agent.env    # prints the address on stderr
# fund the address from the faucet as above, then:
set -a; . ./agent.env; set +a
node dist/main.js
```

## Configuration

Everything is an environment variable; a bad value stops the agent at start rather than being
silently defaulted.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_MNEMONIC` | — (required) | The key. Or `AGENT_URI` for a dev key such as `//Alice//ref`. Set only one. |
| `SCALAR_WS` | `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` | Node endpoint (the testnet is `wss://rpc.scalarnet.io`). |
| `AGENT_MODE` | `provider` | `provider`, `buyer`, or `both`. |
| `AGENT_NAME` | `operator-reference-agent` | Metadata name set at registration. |
| `STAKE_CMN` | `1000` | Stake at registration; up to 12 decimals. |
| `HEARTBEAT_BLOCKS` | `600` | Re-heartbeat interval in blocks. |
| `MIN_DELIVERY_BLOCKS` | `10` | Must match the runtime's `MinDeliveryBlocks`. |
| `BUYER_AMOUNT_CMN` | `10` | Escrow per agreement — the runtime minimum is 10 CMN. |
| `BUYER_PEERS` | — (any) | Comma-separated provider addresses a buyer may deal with. Set this: an arbitrary registered agent may never deliver. |
| `BUYER_MAX_OPEN` | `2` | Open agreements a buyer may hold at once. |
| `BUYER_DELIVER_WITHIN_BLOCKS` | `600` | Deadline given to providers. |
| `POLL_SECONDS` | `6` | Pause between passes. |
| `STATE_DIR` | `./state` (`/state` in the image) | `state.json` and `agent.jsonl`. |

Please keep to a couple of instances and leave `AGENT_NAME` recognisable: seeding the network
with dozens of agents to make it look busy makes the data useless to everyone.

## Check that it worked

```bash
curl -s https://api.scalarnet.io/v1/agents/<your address>
```

You want `stakePlancks` set and `lastHeartbeatBlock` non-zero. The first lines of your log
should be `start`, `register`, `heartbeat`:

```json
{"ts":"…","event":"start","mode":"provider","stake":"1000000000000000","address":"5Exyb…"}
{"ts":"…","event":"register","stake":"1000000000000000","name":"operator-reference-agent","tx":"0x…"}
{"ts":"…","event":"heartbeat","block":"1234","previous":null,"tx":"0x…"}
```

A failed step logs `{"event":"error","step":"…","message":"…"}` and the agent carries on; the
next pass is the retry. Nothing is retried silently.

## Buyer mode

`AGENT_MODE=buyer` (or `both`) makes the agent open a `BUYER_AMOUNT_CMN` agreement with another
registered agent, then confirm it once the provider has delivered. Funds are reserved when the
agreement is created and released only when *you* confirm, so a buyer should confirm work it
has actually checked — the reference agent confirms anything delivered, because its
counterparty is another reference agent.

The reference buyer does **not** reclaim funds from an agreement whose provider never
delivers; after the deadline you recover them yourself with `escrow.claimRefund`. Until then
the amount stays reserved and counts against `BUYER_MAX_OPEN`.

## Publishing the image (maintainers)

The image build and push need Docker and `write:packages`, neither of which the lab run had.
A draft workflow is in [`docs/ci-drafts/agent-image.yml`](https://github.com/tejaspatil1936/scalar-commons-v4/blob/master/docs/ci-drafts/agent-image.yml):
copy it to `.github/workflows/`, then push a tag `agent-v0.1.0`. Build locally with
`docker build -f agent/Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/tejaspatil1936/scalar-agent:0.1 .` from the
repository root.
