# factory/review.sh — fresh-context adversarial review of a factory PR.
#
#   ./factory/review.sh [--dry-run] <pr-number>
#
# Runs THREE separate `claude -p` calls, one per lens. Each is a brand-new
# process with a fresh context and is handed ONLY:
#   - the complete list of changed file NAMES
#   - the complete diff of every dependency manifest (package.json/Cargo.toml)
#   - a REVIEW DIFF: the PR diff with generated/vendored files excluded
#   - the body of the issue the PR closes
#   - its own lens prompt
#
# Why fresh context: the author agent has spent hours convincing itself the work
# is good. Reviewing inside that context inherits the rationalisation. A
# reviewer that has never seen the author's reasoning can only judge the diff.
#
# Each reviewer is run from a temp dir OUTSIDE the repo, so CLAUDE.md is not
# auto-discovered and no reviewer can wander the tree looking for excuses. The
# rules a reviewer needs are embedded in its lens prompt.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PAST BUG — DO NOT REGRESS (fixed 2026-08-05; see FACTORY-REVIEW-FIX.md)
#
# This script used to invoke `claude -p "$(cat "$pf")"`, passing the whole
# prompt as ONE argv string. Linux caps a SINGLE argument at MAX_ARG_STRLEN =
# 32 pages = 131072 bytes — a limit that is entirely separate from ARG_MAX.
# PR #85's prompt was 317062 bytes, so execve() failed with E2BIG before
# `claude` ever started: exit 126, zero bytes of stdout. review.sh discarded
# that exit code (`|| warn`) and then scored the missing verdict as FAIL, so a
# perfectly good PR was reported as failing all three lenses.
#
# Two rules follow, and both are load-bearing:
#   1. The prompt is fed on STDIN (`claude -p < "$pf"`), never as an argument.
#      A redirect passes a file descriptor, so prompt size is irrelevant to
#      exec and E2BIG cannot recur AT ANY DIFF SIZE. This redirect — not the
#      size caps — is what makes the bug impossible. Do not "optimise" it into
#      `claude -p "$(cat …)"`; factory/tests/verdict-parse.sh asserts against
#      that exact regression and will go red.
#   2. The exit code is captured and a non-zero exit is ERROR, never FAIL.
#      "The reviewer could not run" and "the reviewer objects" are different
#      facts and must never be collapsed into one.
#
# MAX_REVIEW_DIFF_LINES / MAX_REVIEW_DIFF_BYTES bound the diff for
# REVIEWABILITY, not for exec safety. They are not a second E2BIG defence, and
# raising them cannot reintroduce the bug. They have their own hazard: at 1500
# lines the review of PR #85 had a file truncated out and the reviewer invented
# two findings from the gap, so a too-low cap does not merely lose coverage, it
# manufactures false findings. Truncation is therefore always disclosed.
#
# A second, independent bug lived here too: run_lens returned its verdict on
# stdout while also calling log(), which writes to stdout. The caller's
# `v="$(run_lens ...)"` therefore captured "[ts] running lens: …\nPASS", the
# `case "$v" in PASS)` matched neither arm, and the PASS/FAIL tally stayed at
# 0/0 regardless of what the models actually said. Lens results now travel in
# files ($WORK/<lens>.result), never on stdout, so the class of bug is gone.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Verdicts: every lens must end with "VERDICT: PASS" or "VERDICT: FAIL". Three
# outcomes are distinguished, and the distinction matters:
#
#   PASS   the model returned VERDICT: PASS
#   FAIL   the model returned VERDICT: FAIL — a real objection
#   ERROR  the call failed, or exited 0 with no parseable verdict. The review
#          did not happen. This is NEVER reported as PASS and never as FAIL.
#
# Overall status:
#   any ERROR                  -> INCONCLUSIVE: no agent-reviewed, add
#                                 needs-human, exit 2
#   >=2 PASS and no ERROR      -> comment all verdicts + label agent-reviewed
#   any FAIL                   -> label needs-human + comment the objections
#
# The last two rules can BOTH apply (2 PASS + 1 FAIL). That is deliberate: the
# PR records that it cleared the bar AND that an unresolved objection exists.
# merge.sh requires agent-reviewed AND no needs-human, so any FAIL or ERROR
# blocks the merge while preserving the audit trail.
#
# A reviewer that cannot review reports INCONCLUSIVE. It never reports PASS.
#
# review.sh NEVER MERGES. It has no merge code path at all, under any flag.

# decision lives in these four functions, defined UP HERE so the self-test
# entrypoints below can reach them before the script does any work.
#
# They are deliberately pure: no globals, no side effects, no network. That is
# what makes factory/tests/verdict-parse.sh able to test THE REAL CODE instead
# of keeping a private copy that drifts out of agreement with it (which is
# exactly what happened before: the test stayed green while asserting rules
# review.sh no longer had).

# Robust against the ways a model actually writes the line: markdown emphasis
# (**VERDICT: PASS**), stray whitespace, lower case. Requires the colon form, so
# prose like "the verdict was a fail" cannot be mistaken for a verdict line.
# The LAST match wins — a model that reconsiders mid-answer is taken at its
# final word. Only ever run against the model's captured stdout.
# Prints PASS, FAIL, or nothing at all when there is no parseable verdict.

# ---- billing preflight -----------------------------------------------------
# Every lens below is a `claude -p` process, so review.sh spends exactly like
# lib/loop.sh does and must prove its billing source exactly like lib/loop.sh
# does. It did not, and the cost was concrete: under systemd the reviewer
# inherited neither ~/.factory/env's PATH nor ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, so all six
# systemd-launched reviews — 18 of 18 lenses — exited 127, and the next one
# would have found `claude` on PATH with no key and silently billed the
# interactive Max login, which common.sh's preflight exists to forbid.
#
# Placed here deliberately: after the kill switch (a stopped factory spends
# nothing), before the diff is fetched and long before any lens is spawned. It
# fails closed — no key, no review — because an unbilled review is worse than
# no review: it reports a verdict while draining the wrong account.
#
# factory/tests/review-billing.sh asserts both the ordering and the closure.

LENS: CORRECTNESS AND SECURITY.

You are reviewing a diff from an autonomous agent on a Substrate/Polkadot SDK
blockchain (Scalar Commons) whose native token has a hard 100B supply cap.

Hunt specifically for:
  - Arithmetic that can overflow, underflow, or truncate. On this chain ALL
    balance arithmetic must use saturating_* or checked_*; a bare + - * on a
    Balance is a defect.
  - Any path that could mint beyond the supply cap, or mint outside the
    emissions pallet.
  - Guards that fire AFTER funds move rather than before (ensure! must precede
    reserve/transfer/mint).
  - Removed or weakened economic guards: self-link checks, minimum-volume
    floors, bonus caps, double-settlement guards.
  - A privileged/root caller introduced into an economically essential path
    (era settlement and reward claims must stay permissionless).
  - Panics, unwraps, or indexing that a hostile caller can reach.
  - Storage layout changes with no migration and no spec_version bump.
  - Off-by-one and boundary errors; incorrect rounding direction (rounding must
    never favour the claimant).

Be concrete: cite the file and the line from the diff. Do not speculate about
code you cannot see; judge what the diff actually does. If the diff is correct
and safe, say so plainly — a clean PASS is a valid and useful outcome.

    cat <<'EOF'
LENS: SPEC CONFORMANCE — does the diff do what the issue asked, and NOTHING MORE?

Two failure modes, both of which you must treat as FAIL:
  1. UNDER-DELIVERY: the issue asked for something the diff does not do, or
     does only partially, or fakes (a stub that satisfies a signature without
     implementing behaviour).
  2. SCOPE CREEP: the diff changes things the issue never asked for —
     opportunistic refactors, renames, reformatting of untouched code, new
     dependencies, unrelated files, "while I was here" edits. In an autonomous
     factory, unrequested change is unreviewed risk, so it is a defect even
     when the change looks like an improvement.

The CHANGED FILES list and the DEPENDENCY MANIFEST CHANGES section are complete
even where the diff body is not: use them to judge scope creep and new
dependencies, which are exactly the things a truncated diff would otherwise
hide.

Go requirement by requirement through the issue and state, for each, whether
the diff satisfies it, citing diff lines. Then list every change in the diff
that no requirement asked for.

Judge only the issue text and the diff. If the issue is ambiguous, say which
reading you applied.

LENS: STANDING-RULE VIOLATIONS.

The single standing rule of this factory:
  NEVER make a check pass by weakening code.

An agent under gate pressure has a cheap escape: make the check stop checking.
Your only job is to find every instance. List EVERY OCCURRENCE with file and
line — not a sample, not "several instances", every one.

Search the diff for:
  - Tests deleted, renamed away, commented out, #[ignore]d, skipped,
    it.skip/xit/describe.skip, or otherwise removed from execution.
  - Assertions weakened: assert_eq! -> assert!, a tightened bound loosened, an
    exact value replaced by a range or a truthiness check, an expected error
    changed to accept anything.
  - todo!(), unimplemented!(), unreachable!() used as an implementation, empty
    function bodies, `fn main() {}` in node/ or runtime/ paths.
  - #[allow(...)] or eslint-disable added to silence a lint rather than fix it.
  - SKIP_WASM_BUILD, or build steps disabled/short-circuited.
  - The gate or CI config itself relaxed: test commands narrowed, --no-run
    added, workspace scope reduced, failing checks removed, timeouts inflated
    to mask hangs, `|| true` appended to a failing command.
  - Error handling replaced by silent swallowing (empty catch, `let _ =`,
    unwrap_or_default hiding a real failure).

If you find NONE of these, that is a legitimate PASS; say so explicitly. If you
find even one, it is a FAIL. There is no severity threshold for this lens.

VERDICT_FMT='
Finish your response with a final line that is EXACTLY one of:
VERDICT: PASS
VERDICT: FAIL
Nothing after it. If you are uncertain about the CODE, choose FAIL and explain
the doubt. Uncertainty caused by material you were not given is not a reason to
FAIL — say what you could not see instead.
Before that line, give your reasons concisely, citing file:line from the diff.'
