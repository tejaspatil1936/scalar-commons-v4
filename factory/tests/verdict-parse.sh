# factory/tests/verdict-parse.sh — prove review.sh's verdict logic fails CLOSED.
#
# The reviewer's tally decides whether a PR gets labelled agent-reviewed, which
# is a precondition for merge. If a garbled, missing, or never-produced verdict
# were read as PASS, an unreviewed diff could reach the trunk. So this logic is
# safety-critical and gets its own test.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS TEST INVOKES THE REAL review.sh. IT DOES NOT KEEP A COPY OF ITS LOGIC.
#
# It used to. The old version pasted review.sh's grep/awk pipeline into itself
# and asserted against the paste. When review.sh's rules changed in #86, this
# file kept passing while asserting rules review.sh no longer had —
# green-but-wrong, the worst state for a safety test, because it reports
# confidence it has not earned.
#
# Everything below therefore drives review.sh's own self-test entrypoints:
#   review.sh --parse-verdict <file>        PASS | FAIL | (empty)
#   review.sh --classify <rc> <file>        PASS | FAIL | ERROR
#   review.sh --status <pass> <fail> <err>  PASS | FAIL | INCONCLUSIVE
#   review.sh --labels <pass> <fail> <err>  "<agent-reviewed> <needs-human>"
#
# Those entrypoints dispatch on $1 before review.sh does any work, so this test
# makes no API call, spends no spawn budget, and touches no PR. If the parser
# regresses, this test goes RED — that is the whole point of it existing.
