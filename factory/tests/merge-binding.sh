# factory/tests/merge-binding.sh — prove the review/merge contract is mechanical.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (audit findings I-13 causes 3 and 4)
#
# Two defects, one test file, because they meet in the same decision:
#
#   cause 4 — `agent-reviewed` was a naked label. dispatch.sh re-pushes from a
#   reused worktree every hour, so commits nobody reviewed could land on a PR
#   that kept the label. "Any FAIL from any lens blocks the merge" held by
#   convention, not by mechanism. The fix binds the label to a head SHA:
#   review.sh records the SHA it actually reviewed in its verdict comment, and
#   merge.sh refuses when the PR head has moved on.
#
#   cause 3 — both open PRs were BEHIND, and with
#   `required_status_checks.strict: true` GitHub blocks out-of-date branches
#   while merge.sh had no update-branch step. Even a perfectly clean, fully
#   reviewed PR could never merge. The fix runs `gh pr update-branch`, waits
#   for the new checks, and only then merges.
#
# Those two fixes collide, and the collision is the interesting case: an
# update-branch MOVES the head, which by cause 4's rule invalidates the review
# binding. Refusing there would put the factory straight back where the audit
# found it — permanently unable to merge anything. Accepting anything with the
# reviewed SHA somewhere in its history would hand back the hole cause 4 closed.
#
# So the exception is narrow and mechanically checked, not asserted: the new
# head is accepted only if it is a merge commit whose FIRST parent is exactly
# the reviewed SHA and whose SECOND parent is already contained in the base
# branch — the precise shape `gh pr update-branch` produces, and a shape that
# cannot introduce a line of unreviewed change. Anything else is STALE.
#
# Everything below drives merge.sh's own self-test entrypoints and a real
# throwaway git repo. No network, no API spend, no PR is touched.
