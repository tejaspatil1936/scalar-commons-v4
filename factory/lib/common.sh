# ---- billing preflight ----------------------------------------------------
# Loops bill the Claude Max subscription, not a metered API key (LAB decision
# 002 amendment, 27 Sep 2026 Max-subscription cutover: this box no longer has
# an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL — the inference proxy is retired).
#
# Verified behaviour (claude 2.1.220): the CLI uses the claude.ai (Max) login
# UNLESS ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or another auth source) is set, in which case that
# takes precedence and disables claude.ai connectors. So Max billing requires
# the *absence* of a key, not its presence — the inverse of the old policy.
#
# NOT A PREFLIGHT GUARANTEE ANY MORE, and the old "fails closed" framing does
# not carry over honestly: there is no longer a condition this function
# refuses to run under, because there is nothing left to check FOR (an OAuth
# login is either on disk or it isn't, and probing for that here would just
# be a second, redundant place for that check to go stale). What this
# function still owns, and fails closed on in the sense that matters: a
# leftover API-auth env var must never silently redirect billing at the
# retired proxy (that exact failure mode killed the 217/219/223/225 tasks
# mid-GATING, 2026-09-27 ~01:51-02:36 UTC — one real attempt, then three
# instant, unparseable exits). If Max auth itself is unreachable, `claude -p`
# fails loudly on its own and the caller's normal attempt/gate bounds handle
# it — that failure path was already exercised and did not need duplicating
# here.
#
# Scrub is scoped to this box's known auth surface: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/
# BASE_URL/AUTH_TOKEN, the three that route to a key or a proxy instead of
# the Max login. It does NOT cover CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK/VERTEX or an
# apiKeyHelper in settings — this box uses neither, so they are out of scope
# rather than silently handled; a box that does would need this extended.

# ---- guards ---------------------------------------------------------------
# ---- daily spawn budget ---------------------------------------------------
# Token cost is not observable from a headless `claude -p` call, so the factory
# bounds the thing it CAN count: how many agent processes it starts per day.
# Every spawn appends one line to a dated ledger; the ledger IS the counter, so
# it doubles as an audit trail of what was started and when.
#
# The date lives in the FILENAME, so the budget resets at 00:00 UTC with no
# cron, no cleanup job, and no clock arithmetic that could go wrong.
#
# This is a local guard rail, not a billing control. The Anthropic Console
# monthly cap remains the hard backstop; this exists so a runaway loop is
# stopped in minutes by the machine that started it, rather than in days by a
# billing alert.
# count_lines <file> -> the number of lines, or 0 if the file is missing.
#
# `grep -c '' "$f" 2>/dev/null || echo 0` is the idiom this replaces, and it is
# WRONG in a way that hides: on a file that exists but is EMPTY, grep prints "0"
# AND exits 1, so the `|| echo 0` fires and the result is the two-line string
# "0\n0". Every arithmetic use of that then fails:
#
#   [ "0\n0" -ge 40 ]        -> "integer expression expected", test is false
#   "attempts": "0\n0"       -> a string stored under a numeric key
#
# It has now caused three separate defects in this repo: the `attempts` field in
# two task state files, shell errors printed into review bodies via review.sh's
# EXCLUDED_N, and -- the one that matters -- a spawn-cap comparison in
# spend_reserve that threw instead of comparing, so the `&& exit 3` never ran and
# the cap FAILED OPEN on an empty ledger.
#
# `wc -l` cannot be substituted naively either: it prints 0 for a file with no
# trailing newline that nonetheless has content. `grep -c ''` counts that line,
# which is why the idiom was chosen. So keep grep and fix the exit code instead.

# ---- model routing --------------------------------------------------------
# Which model runs a given `claude -p`, decided by what the work can break.
#
# Every spawn in this system used to inherit whatever the CLI defaulted to.
# That made the most consequential choice in the whole loop — the model writing
# and reviewing consensus code — an implicit property of a CLI release, and it
# left no record of which model produced which commit.
#
# The rule is deliberately narrow, because a rule with many clauses is a rule
# nobody can predict:
#
#   default            sonnet
#   runtime/ pallets/  opus
#
# Those two directories are the chain. A wrong line in `indexer/` is a bad API
# response someone notices; a wrong line in `pallets/emissions` mints tokens, and
# there is no patch release for a block that has been finalized. Everything else
# in this repo is recoverable by a follow-up commit, so it gets the cheaper
# model and the budget goes where the blast radius is.
#
# Cost-wise this is not a rounding error, which is why the escalation is scoped
# to paths rather than to tiers or labels: a label is set by whoever opened the
# issue, and this decision should not be settable by the thing being judged.
# NOT env-overridable, for the same reason FACTORY_CRITICAL_PATH_RE is not:
# `FACTORY_MODEL_CRITICAL=sonnet` in the environment switched escalation off
# entirely, while every log line still printed a model name as though a
# decision had been made. De-env-ing the path regex and leaving the model
# names behind fixed one half of one hole. FACTORY_MODEL stays the single,
# deliberate, WARNED-about override (see pick_model); these two are the
# policy itself.

# because the loose form also matches `vendor/other-chain/runtime/src/lib.rs`
# and `node/src/runtime_spec.rs`, and a predicate that fires on unrelated files
# stops being read as meaning anything.
# NOT overridable from the environment. An earlier version read this from the
# env "for flexibility", which meant one exported variable could switch off
# escalation entirely and nothing would look wrong — the log line would still
# print a model name. A knob whose only use is to disable a safety rule is not a
# knob. Changing which directories are consensus-critical is a code change,
