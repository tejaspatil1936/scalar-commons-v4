# Loops bill the Claude Max subscription, not a metered API key (LAB decision
# 002 amendment, 27 Sep 2026 Max-subscription cutover: this box no longer has
# an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL — the inference proxy is retired).
#
# Verified behaviour (claude 2.1.220): the CLI uses the claude.ai (Max) login
# UNLESS ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or another auth source) is set, in which case that
# takes precedence and disables claude.ai connectors. So Max billing requires
# the *absence* of a key, not its presence — the inverse of the old policy.
#
# This still fails closed on the thing that actually matters now: a stray key
# left in the environment would silently switch billing back to a dead proxy
# and every loop would die instantly (see the 217/219/223/225 incident,
# 2026-09-27 ~01:51-02:36 UTC — exactly this signature). So this function
# scrubs any inherited API-auth env vars rather than requiring one.

#
# The date lives in the FILENAME, so the budget resets at 00:00 UTC with no
# cron, no cleanup job, and no clock arithmetic that could go wrong.

# monthly cap remains the hard backstop; this exists so a runaway loop is
# stopped in minutes by the machine that started it, rather than in days by a
# billing alert.

# ENDGOAL §3.6's "any FAIL from any lens blocks the merge" held by convention
# rather than by mechanism (audit finding I-13, cause 4).
#
# The binding is the SHA review.sh actually read, written into its verdict
# comment as an HTML comment — invisible in the rendered thread, durable in the
# API body, and impossible to set by adding a label. merge.sh reads it back and
# refuses a head that has moved on.
#
# Emitter and parser live together HERE, in the one file both scripts source,
# so the format cannot drift apart the way review.sh and its old test did.
