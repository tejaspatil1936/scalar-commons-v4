# THE FAILURE MODE THIS SCRIPT EXISTS TO PREVENT
#
# Disabling password login on a box you reach BY password locks you out of it
# permanently, and on a rented host that means a rescue console or a rebuild.
# So every precondition below is checked BEFORE anything is written, and any
# one of them failing aborts with a loud message and a non-zero exit. The
# script never writes a partial configuration: it validates the merged config
# with `sshd -t` and only then reloads, and if validation fails it restores
# what was there before.
#
# It also does not trust that installing a file changed a setting. After the
# reload it re-reads the EFFECTIVE configuration with `sshd -G` and fails if
# any of the three values is not what was asked for.
