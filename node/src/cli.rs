//! Ported from `substrate/bin/node/cli/src/cli.rs` at tag `polkadot-stable2503`.
//!
//! Two things the reference carries are deliberately absent here:
//!
//! * `mixnet_params` — this runtime has no mixnet pallet, so there is nothing
//!   for the flag to configure.
//! * the `Inspect` and `Benchmark` subcommands — see `ROUND4.md`; they pull in
//!   `node-inspect` / `frame-benchmarking-cli`, and the benchmark path also
//!   requires a `runtime-benchmarks` feature that this runtime does not yet
//!   wire completely.
//!
//! Everything else is the reference's set, verbatim in shape.
