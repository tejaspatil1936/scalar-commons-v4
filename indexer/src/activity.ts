 * doing" — registrations, liveness, the agreement lifecycle, disputes, oracle
 * votes, slashes and messages, in one stream. It is a projection over the event
 * index, not a second store: every row it returns is an event row the indexer
 * already holds, so the feed can never disagree with `/v1/events` about what a
 * block contained.
 *
 * Classification is by exact `(pallet, event)` pair. Matching on the method
 * name alone would let any pallet that happens to emit an `AgentRegistered`
 * write itself into another pallet's history.

 *
 * The pallet landed in runtime **309** (PR #242) and its section is `messages`.
 * This list was written before it existed and guessed at `messaging` and
 * `agentMessaging`; neither is what shipped, so the feed silently reported zero
 * messages against a chain that had them. Found by sending a real message
 * through the SDK on dev-real and watching `/v1/activity` stay empty, which is
 * also the only way it could have been found — a wrong section name matches
 * nothing and raises nothing, in the indexer or in its tests.
 *
 * The two guessed names are kept alongside the real one. They cost one array
 * entry each, and the failure they protect against is exactly the one that just
 * happened: a rename on the runtime side that nothing here would notice.
 *
 * Oracle votes are the two ways an agent answers a request — singly or in a
 * batch. Request creation, finalisation and expiry are about the request, not
 * about any one agent's vote, and stay out. Slash appeals sit beside the slash
 * itself: an appeal is the agent's side of the same proceeding.
